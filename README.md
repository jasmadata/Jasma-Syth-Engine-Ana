## 🛠 Installation

### Basic Installation
```bash
pip install jasma-syth
```


## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
from jasma_syth import DataSynthesizer

# Initialize synthesizer with config
synthesizer = DataSynthesizer("config.yaml")

# Generate synthetic dataset
data = synthesizer.generate_data(samples=1000)
```

## 📊 Example Configurations

### Basic Configuration
```yaml
generators:
  user_age:
    type: numerical
    params:
      distribution: normal
      mean: 30
      std_dev: 10
      min_value: 18
      max_value: 80
    description: "User age distribution"
```

### Advanced Configuration
```yaml
generators:
  transaction_amount:
    type: numerical
    params:
      distribution: lognormal
      mean: 100
      std_dev: 50
      min_value: 10
      seed: 42
    constraints:
      - type: "range"
        min: 0
      - type: "outlier"
        threshold: 0.01
    description: "Transaction amounts in USD"
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Distributions
```python
from jasma_syth import BaseGenerator

class CustomGenerator(BaseGenerator):
    def generate(self, n: int) -> np.ndarray:
        # Your custom generation logic here
        pass
```

### Streaming Data Generation
```python
with synthesizer.stream(batch_size=100) as stream:
    for batch in stream:
        process_data(batch)
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run linting
black src/ tests/
pylint src/ tests/
```
